About THCHS30 Dataset 
------------------------------------
THCHS30 is an open Chinese speech database published by Center for Speech and Language Technology (CSLT) at Tsinghua University.

Actually this dataset is for researchers in the field of speech recognition,
but there is no any mandarin open-source dataset for speech synthesis, so we
use part of this dataset to demostrate mandarin tts.
